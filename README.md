![Emploee Tracker](https://github.com/ahrumnoh/EmploeeTracker/blob/main/assets/images/Interface%20Employee%20Database.jpg?raw=true)



## Overview

Developers frequently have to create interfaces that allow non-developers to easily view and interact with information stored in databases. These interfaces are called content management systems (CMS). Your assignment this week is to build a command-line application from scratch to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL.


## A finalized sample for Interface
